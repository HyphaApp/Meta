# Hypha Workflows

Hypha has four built-in workflows that you can select from when you create a new Fund.  Each workflow is designed to accommodate a different process/pathway that granting organizations might use in soliciting and reviewing proposals&#x20;

_Explanation of each of the "Status" nodes (Stages)_

* _What does it mean_
* _Who needs to view the proposal/application at each stage?_
* _Is there automatic routing? (I think the answer to this is no)_
* _What steps must be taken (and who needs to take those steps) to advance proposal to next stage?_
