## Debug Toolbar

More info on the Django debug toolbar is [here](https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

## Disable toolbars

We disable all panels by default here since some of them (SQL, Template, Profiling) can be very CPU intensive for this site. However disabled panels can be easily toggled on in the UI.

## Testing the apis from postman - _leave as is unless you have a compelling reason not to._
