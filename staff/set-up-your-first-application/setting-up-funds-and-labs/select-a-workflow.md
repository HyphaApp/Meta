# Select a Workflow

The **Workflow** defines the stages and processes that the application should undertake with OTF. Creating a new Fund or Lab requires you to select one of these workflows.&#x20;

Each workflow has a predetermined amount of stages (e.g. request, proposal), application forms, review forms, and determination forms associated with this Fund or Lab. &#x20;

Each workflow offers different statuses (e.g. External Review, Ready for Determination), and different actions (e.g Invite to proposal).&#x20;

The four hard-coded workflows are: Request, Request with external review, Request with community review, Concept & Proposal.
