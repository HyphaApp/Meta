# Setting up funds and labs

## Creating a new fund, either:

* Add a [new fund ](broken-reference)in the top right or [copy an existing fund](broken-reference) (mouse over the row to show options)
* You will then be able to add the following information
  * Name of the fund (Title)
  * Default reviewers - relevant advisory council members
  * [Workflow](broken-reference)
    * Workflow defines the stages and processes that the application should undertake with OTF
    * Currently there are four workflows you can select.
  * Assign [application forms](broken-reference)
    * Created previously in stage 1
    * Number validated against the workflow chosen above (i.e. if it is a concept/proposal workflow 2 forms must be selected)
  * Assign [review forms](broken-reference)
    * Created previously in stage 2
    * Number validated against the workflow chosen above (i.e. if it is a concept/proposal workflow 2 forms must be selected)
  * Confirmation email
* Previewing the fund (red below) allows you to see what the application form will look like when it is live
* [Publishing the fund ](broken-reference)(yellow) is required to make sure that the application form is publicly visible to users.
