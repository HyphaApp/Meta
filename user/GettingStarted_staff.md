# Getting Started for Staff

### *Understanding how Hypha integrates into your organization's workflow*

<br>

## Granting organizations' workflow:

1. Determine **kind of project** to be funded (e.g. grantmaking categories or thematic areas)
2. Outline **expected steps** in application process (e.g. # of stages)
3. Decide on **timeline** for application process (e.g., due dates vs. rolling)
4. Generate **questions for/information needed** from the applicant 
5. Disseminate **request for proposals**
6. Specify **review criteria**
7. **Assign reviewers** to received applications
8. Review applications & **make decisions** about which projects to fund


<br>

## Workflow in Hypha:
 - First, you create **"Forms"** for:
    - *applicants* (application forms) [4]
    - *reviewers* (review criteria) [6]
    - and *determinations* (decisions) [8]
 - Then, you create a **"Fund"** in which you:
    - Specify *expected steps* [2] & *reviewers* [7]
    - Attach the *applicant* [4], *reviewer* [6], and *determination* [8] **Forms**
 - Next, you create a **"Round"** that associates a **Fund** with the *timeline* [3] for accepting applications 
 - Finally, you can generate a **"Page"** that hosts:
    - information about the *kind of project* to be funded [1]
    - the *request for proposals* [5] (*this may be incorporated with [1]*)
    - a *link to apply* (this links to the **Round**)
