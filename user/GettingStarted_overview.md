## How Hypha Works


 Hypha uses the Wagtail content management system - many instructional guides relevant for Hypha users can be found at [Wagtail's "Editor's Guide" documentation](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/editor_manual/index.html).

 When appropriate, links in this documentation may direct to pages that are part of the documentation linked above.
