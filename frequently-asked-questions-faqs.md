# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**How can I learn more about Hypha?**

1. One of our Hypha maintainers (the folks who are working on building Hypha) can schedule a 1:1 meeting with you to talk about Hypha's capabilities and the needs of your organization and whether Hypha might be right for you. You can request this by replying to [this post on our community forum](https://we.hypha.app/t/new-adopters-request-to-speak-to-hypha-oss-maintainers/253). \

2. Check out our Getting Started documentation\

3.  Visit one of our online forums&#x20;

    Please contact \[ ] if you would like to have a meeting or join this online forum\


**How can I contribute to this open source project?**

We are humbled and grateful for any code, design, documentation, bug reports, virtual hugs, and any other forms of contributions made to Hypha.

We aim to foster design and development improvements that would benefit the entire Hypha community. For major changes that would impact Hyphaâ€™s core infrastructure and cross-projects, we encourage a public discussion to help the community become aware of the need and the problems contributors are working to solve. This public discussion can often help contributors recruit others to help do the work, as well as gather feedback.

We are interested in learning more about any challenges and feedback on how to improve the platform. Please submit your bug reports to the main repo here: \[insert GitHub repo]

Adopters could also provide input into new designs, user research, etc. There are several types of contributions you can make:

* Adopter contributions/user agreements
* UX contributions/user agreements
* Design contributions/user agreements

**3. Is there a governance structure for adopters deploying their own forks and instances?**

Instances working on their own development fork can make their own technical decisions and manage their day-to-day activities, create new repositories in their orgs, etc., with independence and autonomy. Implementers determine their own decision making processes at the instance level, and evolve their own self-governance based on the skills assembled.
