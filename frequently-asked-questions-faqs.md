**How can I learn more about Hypha?**

1. One of our Hypha maintainers (the folks who are working on building Hypha) can schedule a 1-on-1 meeting with you to talk about Hypha's capabilities and the needs of your organization and whether Hypha might be right for you. You can request this by replying to [this post on our community forum](https://we.hypha.app/t/new-adopters-request-to-speak-to-hypha-oss-maintainers/253).\

**Is there a governance structure for adopters deploying their own forks and instances?**

Instances working on their own development fork can make their own technical decisions and manage their day-to-day activities, create new repositories in their orgs, etc., with independence and autonomy. Implementers determine their own decision making processes at the instance level, and evolve their own self-governance based on the skills assembled.

**What is Hypha's data privacy or responsibility policy?**\
A: Hypha is self-hosted. This means that the applications, and all associated information created is available to you and your applicants on your own systems - not handed over to a company where it can be difficult to analyze the data. The Hypha code is regularly audited and has many privacy and security features. [https://www.hypha.app/](https://www.hypha.app)

**How can I contribute to this open source project?**

We are humbled and grateful for any code, design, documentation, bug reports, virtual hugs, and any other forms of contributions made to Hypha.

1. _Want to see new features in Hypha?_\
   \_\_We aim to foster design and development improvements that would benefit the entire Hypha community. For major changes that would impact Hyphaâ€™s core infrastructure and cross-projects, we encourage a public discussion to help the community become aware of the need and the problems contributors are working to solve. This public discussion can often help contributors recruit others to help do the work, as well as gather feedback.
2. _Experiencing a problem with how Hypha is working for you?_\
   We are interested in learning more about any challenges and feedback on how to improve the platform. Please either post on we.hypha (ADD LINK) or submit a bug report (create a new "issue" using our template) in the Hypha main github repo (ADD LINK)
