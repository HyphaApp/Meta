# How to Contribute

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! Hypha is improved by a small community of developers, designers and users. We welcome your contributions. There are many ways to contribute to Hypha - code, design, documentation and translation. Before you start working however, please read our [code of conduct](https://docs.hypha.app/contributing/codeofconduct).

### Documentation contribution

We use the [hypha-docs](https://github.com/HyphaApp/hypha-docs/) Github repository, [Gitbook](http://gitbook.com) to create and manage this [docs.hypha.app](https://github.com/HyphaApp/hypha-docs/tree/28645093d1c0c315e18bf474b724eda4ea399a18/contributing/docs.hypha.app) website.

### Design contribution

All design contributions are managed in Github issues. If you have a usability, or UX design recommendation, you can open a Github issue and use the ["Status: Needs UX/UI Review"](https://github.com/HyphaApp/hypha/labels/Status%3A%20Needs%20UI%2FUX%20review) label.

### Translation

We use [Weblate for managing Hypha translations](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/hypha/).
