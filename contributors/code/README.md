Github repo address (TBA)

Recommendations for how to get involved if you're not currently affiliated with an organization using Hypha
 - join our forums (link to Commune with us page)
 - lurk on the repo and follow comments before actually doing stuff

*Some of the stuff from the Contributors README page might belong here, especially if it's code-specific*
