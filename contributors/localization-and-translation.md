# Localization and Translation

Hypha offers translations into another language or translations into your organisation's vocabulary, or a combination of both. Hypha has functionalities for adopters to localize their own version with [Weblate](https://weblate.org) or install another translation service if they prefer. Translations could also be implemented with a text editor.
