## Who are you?

  * See [_Getting Started for Staff_](gettingstarted/gettingstarted\_overview/gettingstarted\_staff.md)
* I **review incoming applications** (e.g., as a staff member of a grantmaking organization or as a community partner/volunteer)
  * See _Getting Started for Reviewers_(link to be added)
* I am **applying for a grant** with an organization that uses Hypha software
  * _NOTE: Not sure if we want a general page here or if we want to provide a template for Deployers to create their own org-specific "for Applicants" page._
* I am **deploying Hypha** for a grantmaking organization
  * See [_Deployment Documentation_](https://github.com/HyphaApp/hypha-docs/tree/6dc9369f007edcaf35909d4e14bf88088949e74a/gettingstarted\_overview/deployment/README.md) or [_Configuration Documentation_](gettingstarted/gettingstarted\_overview/configuration/)

* I hold more than one of the above roles and I don't know which "Getting Started" to pick!
  * Introduce yourself on one or more of our [Communities](gettingstarted/gettingstarted\_overview/commune-with-us.md), and our community members can help point you in the right direction!
