# Getting Started

The examples in this document are based on Hypha's [demo site](https://sandbox.opentech.fund). However, the instructions are general enough as to be applicable to any Hypha site.

Hypha uses the Wagtail content management system - many instructional guides relevant for Hypha users can be found at [Wagtail's "Editor's Guide" documentation](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/editor\_manual/index.html).
