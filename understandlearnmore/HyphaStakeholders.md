# Hypha Stakeholders

## To be edited:

_General statement about Hypha's open-source nature, guided and developed by community, for community. Here are the folks involved with Hypha, we invite you to join our community_

\


**Questions:**

* What **contact information** should we put for each person?
  * Currently, this is github user pages
  * _My suggestion is that we use we.hypha.app "summary page" - e.g. Emily Carrigan(https://we.hypha.app/u/emlini/summary)_
* Need a **check-in with everyone listed here**, to ensure they're okay with (1) being included, (2) the contact info we've provided, and (3) the wording of their affiliations/roles
  * _Better to do PMs, maybe?_
* **What distinguishes** a Sponsor from an Implementer?
  * _For instance, should we add ARDC and DFF as Sponsors_
