# Hypha Stakeholders

## To be edited:
*General statement about Hypha's open-source nature, guided and developed by community, for community.  Here are the folks involved with Hypha, we invite you to join our community*

<br>

**Questions:**
 * What **contact information** should we put for each person?
   * Currently, this is github user pages
   * *My suggestion is that we use we.hypha.app "summary page" - e.g. Emily Carrigan(https://we.hypha.app/u/emlini/summary)*
* Need a **check-in with everyone listed here**, to ensure they're okay with (1) being included, (2) the contact info we've provided, and (3) the wording of their affiliations/roles
    * *Better to do PMs, maybe?*
* **What distinguishes** a Sponsor from an Implementer?
    * *For instance, should we add ARDC and DFF as Sponsors*

<br>
