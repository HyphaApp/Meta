The first user account is created when you install Hypha with this command:

python manage.py createsuperuser

This is an "administrator" role, a default Django role that bypasses any access restrictions, like root on a Unix server.

This role should only be used by the person implementing Hypha for your organization, who may either be part of the organization or an external contractor.

Creating additional users and assigning them Roles is done in Wagtail by someone with the Staff role

STEPS FOR THIS
> ℹ️ Only users with the ["Staff"](gettingstarted_overview/hypha_roles.md) Role can do this_

## From the Dashboard, click the "Apply admin"
