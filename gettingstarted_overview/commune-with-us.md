# Commune with us!

### We.hypha

This is our community forum powered by [discourse](https://www.discourse.org). It is a place where the wider Hypha community come together to discuss topics relating to your own deployment/instance of Hypha, the Hypha core OSS and any technical, product or informational needs of Hypha generally. We also keep our meeting notes in forum posts and our requests for collaboration on features and improvements can happen.

The community forum is also where you can [introduce yourself if you are new to Hypha](https://we.hypha.app/t/welcome-to-the-hypha-lounge/8/5) and where you can [raise proposals for the OSS Hypha community](https://we.hypha.app/t/sociocracy-proposal-framework/171).

### Zulip

The Hypha [Zulip](https://zulip.com) is a chat room like tool that we use to communicate across the Hypha community. This is often where folks can find announcements for regular meeting dates with agendas, where Adopters can raise questions, ideas, problems and needs informally before submitting a more detailed request for a feature or alogging a bug on the community forum or Github. Zuli has multiple channels with the ability for anyone to create a new channel in relation to a topic of their choice and also has direct messaging functions.

\~\~~~\~~~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

### Github

Github is where we keep our tasks that are directly related to the product or software of Hypha. This is primarily where members of the 'software' or 'product' OSS team do their day to day work. You'll find the OSS Lead developer, OSS Product Manager and OSS Design Lead here along with other OSS volunteer contributors that make the Hypha OSS software what is is and keeps everything running smoothly. The people that participate on GitHub also might include paid contractors for specific Hypha Adopters where they may be 'contributing' work that has been done on their own specific adopter instances to the core Hypha OSS codebase. On Github you can raise a[ ](https://github.com/HyphaApp/hypha/issues/new/choose)[new issue using a variety of detailed, explained template](https://github.com/HyphaApp/hypha/issues/new/choose)s or submit [a](https://github.com/HyphaApp/hypha/compare)[ pull request if you are contributing to the code or other aspects of the core Hypha OSS directl](https://github.com/HyphaApp/hypha/compare)y. We have a core [OSS Hypha Github organisation](https://github.com/HyphaApp) which has multiple repositories of work for the project from codebases to docs. Some of which are private due to the sensitive nature of the content. Issues are descriptions of tasks within the Hypha OSS project and may be 'shared' needs/tasks across Adopters Hypha instances but the core Hypha OSS github is where the 'open' and public issues are described. You'll find conversations about how we intend to implement certain work on the core Hypha OSS here as well as approval processes and 'what's been released' lately on the software in [releases](https://github.com/HyphaApp/hypha/releases). We also keep[ ](https://github.com/HyphaApp/hypha/projects)[project board](https://github.com/HyphaApp/hypha/projects)s where tasks move between columns like 'to do' 'in progress' and 'done' for example. Lastly, github hosts a[ ](https://github.com/HyphaApp/hypha/wiki)[wik](https://github.com/HyphaApp/hypha/wiki)i section where information like roadmaps, plans, meeting notes and newsletters are. We have a seperat[e ](https://github.com/HyphaApp/hypha-docs)[Github repository for our documentation informati](https://github.com/HyphaApp/hypha-docs)on.

### Slack

Our slack workspaces are 'owned' by either the Adopter funding organisations or one of the contractor organisations and there are shared channels between multiple folks. Slack is for communications between the Adopters of Hypha OSS that are paying for contract work on the core OSS code of Hypha (Not an Adopter instance) by invite only.
