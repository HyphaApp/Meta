# Commune with us!

### We.hypha



This is our community forum powered by [discourse](https://www.discourse.org). It is a place where the wider Hypha community come together to discuss topics relating to your own deployment/instance of Hypha, the Hypha core OSS and any technical, product or informational needs of Hypha generally. We also keep our meeting notes in forum posts and our requests for collaboration on features and improvements can happen.

Introduce yourself! (link to introduction post in Lounge space - pinned in we.hypha.app)
