### If your organization needs roles with different permissions than those listed here, these can be created and permissions can be set in Wagtail by the person deploying Hypha for your organization.

For example, current Hypha whitelabel includes the following roles, which were created for different Hypha adopters

* **Community Reviewer**
* **Team Admin**

## Assigning Roles

**Staff** \(or **Admin**\) can either assign roles when a user account is created, or can add/modify roles for existing users.
