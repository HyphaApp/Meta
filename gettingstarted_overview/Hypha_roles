Roles in Hypha

**Administrators**

**Staff** can do the most in Hypha - they can:
- set up applications (this means creating Forms, Funds, and Rounds - see [Getting Started for Staff](https://docs.hypha.app/gettingstarted_overview/gettingstarted_staff) for an overview of how the process works)
- see submissions
- create accounts, and give other users (e.g. Reviewers or other Staff) access to applications/submissions
- communicate with Applicants
- review applications/submissions
- process determinations/decisions
- disburse funds(?)
___

**Staff** create **Reviewer** accounts, and then Staff can:
- *specify a list of Reviewers* when creating a "Fund", or
- *individually assign reviewers to specific applications* that have been received for a given Fund

___
**Reviewers** are given access to specific applications (or a set of applications) by Staff. They can then:
- look at those applications
- complete Review Forms for each application they are assigned to
- I *think* this is all, but there may be some other functionality Reviewers have that I'm not aware of.

___
